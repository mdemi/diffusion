# Diffusion
A PyTorch implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with a UNet architecture.

We train diffusion models on three datasets:
1- Galaxies: Images of galaxies obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
2- Particles: 2D projections of simulated energy deposition patterns of particles.
3- Triangulations: Fine Regular triangulations of an 8x8 grid.
